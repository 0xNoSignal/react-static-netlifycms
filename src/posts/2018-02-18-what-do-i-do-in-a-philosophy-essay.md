Philosophy essay topics are not designed to provide an intellectual obstacle course that trips you up so as to delight a malicious marker. They are designed to invite you to "grapple with" with some particular philosophical problem or issue. That is to say, they are designed to offer you an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of a particular philosophical problem or issue, and to exhibit your own philosophical skills of analysis, argumentation, etc. These twin goals are usually best achieved by ensuring that your essay performs two basic functions (your understanding and your skills apply to both):



an exposition of the problem or issue in question (often as it is posed in some particular text); and

a critical discussion of the problem or text



These two functions can, but need not always, correspond to physically or structurally distinct sections of your essay. See Section 5.1.
